# PointerFixer-ProMaxUltra

PointerFixer-ProMaxUltra is a lightweight macOS CLI tool that resets your mouse pointer when it gets stuck or doesn't update correctly. It can fix cases where the cursor stays as a default arrow even when it should show as a resize, drag, or text cursor.

This tool is built with native macOS frameworks and has no dependencies.

## Introduction

macOS sometimes fails to update the cursor properly — for example, leaving it stuck in the wrong style when resizing windows or switching apps. PointerFixer-ProMaxUltra solves this by forcing a refresh: it temporarily changes the cursor, waits a short moment, and switches it back to default, triggering a redraw.

## How to Use

### 1. Download

Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/bleedweedsuz/PointerFixer-ProMaxUltra/releases) section and download the latest `pfix` file.

> You don’t need to install anything. This is a precompiled macOS binary.

### 2. Install (Optional)

To use it from anywhere in Terminal, move it to `/usr/local/bin`:

```bash
chmod +x pfix
sudo mv pfix /usr/local/bin
